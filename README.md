- CSS custom properties
- Mobileview:screen 

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development
As for me, i:
Would add a gallery: If an NFT is part of a collection, you can add a gallery that allows you to view other NFTs from that collection.
Would add a price: If the NFT is a sale product, you can add price information and a button that allows the user to buy the NFT.
Would add history: You can add information about how the NFT was created and what changes were made.
